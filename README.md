# PasswordIOTVerification
## Introduction:
A password verification system contains:
- Password verification.
- A web page.
- Capacity of registering the date of the passwords.

## General Use:
External hardware is needed to use this, an esp32, an lcd display and an 4x4 keypad, the esp32 also needs to be flashed to have the capacity of be programmed with python, tonny ide was used for the development.

First we start the nodejs server that has all the settings for the hash verification, a broker is also needed in this case mosquitto was used.The user needs to install it first after that the service is automatically started, then he needs to run the micropython script with his esp32 connected, but before, is necessary to write the info of the wifi connection that is being used at the moment, the name ```WIFI_SSID``` and the password ```WIFI_PASS```, after running the script the connection with the broker will be made, then the user needs to run the web page, this web page uses the json generated by the input of the user, this json contains all the passwords, then verifies if the hash is correct, if it is, then a message saying allow is shown at the top, on the contrary the message will say fail, the page also has the capability to update the password that the user enter on the keypad, at the end the result will be shown on the lcd display.

## Comunnication Process:
```ESP32``` --> ```MOSQUITTO BROKER``` --> ```NODEJS``` --> ```WEBPAGE VERIFICATION``` --> ```ESP32 CONNECTED DISPLAY```

## Technologies used:
- ESP32 setup with micropython.
- MQTT Broker Mosquitto comunication.
- NodeJs server implementation.
- Hardware usage IOT (LCD Display, 4x4 Keypad)
- JavaScript.
- Html.
- Json Usage.
